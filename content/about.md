I'm a Computer Science student at [UFCG](https://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/)
and a DevOps Engineer at Distributed System Laboratory (or LSD, in Portuguese),
located in my university.

I'm passionate about Linux, Virtualization, Automation and the whole IT field.
In fact, what brought me to where I'm working was the passion I have for Linux and
everything that surrounds it, like living in the terminal.
